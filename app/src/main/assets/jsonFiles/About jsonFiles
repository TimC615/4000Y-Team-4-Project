A file for making notes.

The object names in FormConstructorFilepaths.json must match VisitTypes.json.
The values in FormConstructorFilepaths.json will be the filepath for the json file for each Form Constructor.
Each object in FormConstructorFilepaths.json may contain multiple values - the visit type affects sets of forms rather than individual forms.
