Just a place to put anything to keep in mind while writing the JSON files.

 - when writing RegEx, anything that requires a \ needs to use \\ instead.
 - information about the format of each field can be found in the chapter of the manual for that form

Useful RegEx:

a* == a 0 or more times
a+ == a 1 or more times
a? == a 0 or 1 times
a{x} == a exactly x times
a{x, y} == a between x and y times
a|b == a or b
[abc] == any of a, b, or c
^a == anything but a
[^] == any character

Searching is done between ^ and $.
